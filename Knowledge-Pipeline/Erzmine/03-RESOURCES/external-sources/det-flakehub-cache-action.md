# ️❄️ FlakeHub Cache Action

FlakeHub Cache is the zero-configuration binary cache for GitHub Actions, workstations, production, and other CI platforms.

FlakeHub Cache is part of [Determinate], the best way to use Nix on macOS, WSL, and Linux.
It is an end-to-end toolchain for using Nix, from installation to collaboration to deployment.

Based on the [Determinate Nix Installer][nix-installer] and its corresponding [Nix Installer Action][nix-installer-action], responsible for over tens of thousands of Nix installs daily.

## 🫶 Platform support

- Automatic, authenticated integration with GitHub Actions
- Cached paths are available on developer and target machines
- Fully managed by Determinate Systems
- 🐧 Linux, x86_64, aarch64
- 🍏 macOS (Apple Silicon)
- 🪟 WSL2, x86_64 and aarch64
- 🐋 Containers, ARC, and Act
- 🐙 GitHub Enterprise Server
- 💁 GitHub Hosted, self-hosted, and long running Actions Runners

## ️🔧 Usage

Here's an example Actions workflow configuration that uses `flakehub-cache-action`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  check:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      id-token: "write"
      contents: "read"
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6.0.2
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/determinate-nix-action@v3
      - uses: DeterminateSystems/flakehub-cache-action@v3 # or v3.17.0 to pin to a release
      - run: nix build .
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must add a `permissions` block like the one in the example above or else Determinate Nix can't authenticate with FlakeHub or [FlakeHub Cache][cache].

## 📌 Version pinning: lock it down!

### Why pin your Action?

Unlike `DeterminateSystems/magic-nix-cache-action`, we fully support explicit version pinning for maximum consistency.
This Action is **automatically tagged** for every release, giving you complete control over your CI environment:

📍 Pinning to `DeterminateSystems/flakehub-cache-action@v3.17.0` guarantees:

- Same `flakehub-cache-action` revision every time
- Reproducible CI workflows, even years later

✨ Using `@main` instead? You'll:

- Always get the latest FlakeHub Cache release
- Occasionally participate in phased rollouts (helping us test new releases!)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Set up [Dependabot] to stay current with FlakeHub Cache releases without sacrificing stability.

### 🤖 Automate updates with Dependabot

Keep your GitHub Actions fresh without manual work! Create `.github/dependabot.yml` with:

```yaml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: github-actions
    directory: /
    schedule:
      interval: weekly
```
